description: |
  lambda-ber-schema is a comprehensive schema for representing multimodal structural biology imaging data, 
  from atomic-resolution structures to tissue-level organization. It supports diverse experimental 
  techniques including cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, SAXS/SANS, fluorescence microscopy, and 
  spectroscopic imaging.

  ## Schema Organization

  The schema follows a hierarchical structure that mirrors how structural biology research is organized:

  The top-level entity is a [Dataset](Dataset.md), which serves as a container for related research.
  A dataset might represent all data from a specific grant, collaboration, or publication.

  Each dataset contains one or more [Studies](Study.md), which are focused investigations of specific
  biological questions. For example, a study might investigate "Heat stress response in Arabidopsis"
  or "Structure of the human ribosome under different conditions."

  Within each study, you'll find:

  ### Biological Materials
  - [Samples](Sample.md): The biological specimens being studied (proteins, nucleic acids, complexes, 
    cells, tissues). Each sample includes detailed molecular composition, buffer conditions, and 
    storage information. For example, a purified protein with its sequence, concentration, and buffer pH.
  
  - [Sample Preparations](SamplePreparation.md): How samples were prepared for specific techniques.
    This includes cryo-EM grid preparation (vitrification parameters), crystallization conditions for
    X-ray studies, or staining protocols for fluorescence microscopy.

  ### Data Collection
  - [Instruments](Instrument.md): The equipment used, from Titan Krios microscopes to synchrotron 
    beamlines. Each instrument type ([CryoEMInstrument](CryoEMInstrument.md), 
    [XRayInstrument](XRayInstrument.md), [SAXSInstrument](SAXSInstrument.md)) has specific parameters
    like accelerating voltage, detector type, or beam energy.

  - [Experiment Runs](ExperimentRun.md): Individual data collection sessions that link samples to 
    instruments. An experiment run captures when, how, and under what conditions data was collected,
    including quality metrics like resolution and completeness.

  ### Data Processing
  - [Workflow Runs](WorkflowRun.md): Computational processing steps applied to raw data. This includes
    motion correction for cryo-EM movies, 3D reconstruction, model building, or phase determination
    for crystallography. Each workflow tracks the software used, parameters, and computational resources.

  ### Data Products
  - [Data Files](DataFile.md): Any files generated or used, from raw data to final models. Each file
    is tracked with checksums for data integrity and typed (micrograph, particles, volume, model).

  - [Images](Image.md): Specialized classes for different imaging modalities:
    - [Image2D](Image2D.md): Micrographs, diffraction patterns
    - [Image3D](Image3D.md): 3D reconstructions, tomograms
    - [FTIRImage](FTIRImage.md): Molecular composition maps from infrared spectroscopy
    - [FluorescenceImage](FluorescenceImage.md): Fluorophore-labeled cellular components
    - [OpticalImage](OpticalImage.md): Brightfield/phase contrast microscopy
    - [XRFImage](XRFImage.md): Elemental distribution maps

  ## Example Usage

  A typical cryo-EM study of a protein complex would include:
  1. Sample records for the purified complex with molecular weight and buffer composition
  2. Grid preparation details with vitrification parameters
  3. Microscope specifications and data collection parameters
  4. Processing workflows from motion correction through 3D refinement
  5. Final reconstructed volumes and fitted atomic models

  A multimodal plant imaging study might combine:
  1. Whole plant optical imaging for morphology
  2. XRF imaging to map nutrient distribution
  3. FTIR spectroscopy to identify stress-related molecular changes
  4. Fluorescence microscopy to track specific protein responses
  5. Cryo-EM of isolated organelles for ultrastructural details

  ## Key Features

  - **Technique-agnostic core**: The same schema handles data from any structural biology method
  - **Rich metadata**: Comprehensive tracking from sample to structure
  - **Workflow provenance**: Complete computational reproducibility
  - **Multimodal support**: Seamlessly integrate data across scales and techniques
  - **Standards-compliant**: Follows FAIR principles and integrates with existing ontologies
