The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].\r\n\r\nZinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].\r\n\r\nIn HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].\r\n\r\nThere are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].\r\n\r\nZinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].\r\n\r\nThe change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. \r\n\r\nIn humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].\r\n\r\nIn another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].\r\n\r\nThe exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].","neighbor_flag":"N","pubmed_ids":[23896426],"resource_name":"DrugBank","resource_version":"5.1","target_resource_id":"P69905"},{"cofactor_in_ch_ikey":"HAEJSGLKJYIYTB-ZZXKWVIFSA-N","cofactor_smiles":"OC(=O)\\C=C\\C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(O)=O","cofactor_chem_comp_id":"CIN","cofactor_name":"4-Carboxycinnamic Acid","cofactor_resource_id":"DB02126","neighbor_flag":"N","pubmed_ids":[10592235,37713619],"resource_name":"DrugBank","resource_version":"5.1","target_resource_id":"P69905"},{"cofactor_in_ch_ikey":"TZRXHJWUDPFEEY-UHFFFAOYSA-N","cofactor_smiles":"[O-][N+](=O)OCC(CO[N+]([O-])=O)(CO[N+]([O-])=O)CO[N+]([O-])=O","cofactor_name":"Pentaerythritol tetranitrate","cofactor_resource_id":"DB06154","mechanism_of_action":"Pentaerythritol tetranitrate is the lipid soluble polyol ester of nitric acid belonging to the family of _nitro-vasodilators_.

Compensatory increases in anaerobic respiration result in rising levels of lactic acid and subsequent acidosis. \r\n\r\nNitrite primarily acts by oxidizing hemoglobin to methemoglobin [A19440]. The now oxidized Fe3+ in methemoglobin also binds cyanide with high affinity and accepts cyanide from cytochrome a3. This leaves cytochrome a3 free to resume its function in oxidative phosphorylation. The slow dissociation of cyanide from methemoglobin allows hepatic enzymes such as rhodanese to detoxify the compound without further systemic toxicity occuring. Methemoglobin is reduced back to hemoglobin by methemoglobin reductase allowing the affected blood cells to resume normal functioning.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of nitrite by hemoglobin results in the formation of nitric oxide [A19442].

It is believed that copper is reduced to the Cu1+ form prior to transport. Once inside the enterocyte, it is bound to copper transport protein ATOX1 which shuttles the ion to copper transporting ATPase-1 on the golgi membrane which take up copper into the golgi apparatus. Once copper has been secreted by enterocytes into the systemic circulation it remain largely bound by ceruloplasmin (65-90%), albumin (18%), and alpha 2-macroglobulin (12%). \r\n\r\nCopper is an essential element in the body and is incorporated into many oxidase enzymes as a cofactor [A19518]. It is also a component of zinc/copper super oxide dismutase, giving it an anti-oxidant role. Copper defiency occurs in Occipital Horn Syndrome and Menke's disease both of which are associated with impaired development of connective tissue due to the lack of copper to act as a cofactor in protein-lysine-6-oxidase. Menke's disease is also associated with progressive neurological impairment leading to death in infancy. The precise mechanisms of the effects of copper deficiency are vague due to the wide range of enzymes which use the ion as a cofactor.\r\n\r\nCopper appears to reduce the viabilty and motility of spermatozoa [A19526].

This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver.[A32524] Iron combines with porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which is critical for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues.[L2263]","neighbor_flag":"N","pubmed_ids":[24310424,21694802,18954837],"resource_name":"DrugBank","resource_version":"5.1","target_resource_id":"P69905"},{"cofactor_in_ch_ikey":"SXAWSYZURCZSDX-UHFFFAOYSA-B","cofactor_smiles":"[Fe+3].[Fe+3].[Fe+3].[Fe+3].OP(O)(=O)OP(O)(O)=O.OP(O)(=O)OP(O)(O)=O.OP([O-])(=O)OP([O-])([O-])=O.OC(CC([O-])=O)(CC([O-])=O)C([O-])=O.OC(CC([O-])=O)(CC([O-])=O)C([O-])=O.OC(CC([O-])=O)(CC([O-])=O)C([O-])=O","cofactor_name":"Ferric pyrophosphate citrate","cofactor_resource_id":"DB13995","mechanism_of_action":"The usage of ferric pyrophosphate is based on the strong complex formation between these two species.

The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].\r\n\r\nZinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].\r\n\r\nIn HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].\r\n\r\nThere are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].\r\n\r\nZinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].\r\n\r\nThe change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32417]. \r\n\r\nIn humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].\r\n\r\nIn another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32417]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].\r\n\r\nThe exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].","neighbor_flag":"N","pubmed_ids":[23896426],"resource_name":"DrugBank","resource_version":"5.1","target_resource_id":"P69905"},{"cofactor_in_ch_ikey":"VRIVJOXICYMTAG-IYEMJOQQSA-L","cofactor_smiles":"[Fe++].[H][C@@](O)(CO)[C@@]([H])(O)[C@]([H])(O)[C@@]([H])(O)C([O-])=O.[H][C@@](O)(CO)[C@@]([H])(O)[C@]([H])(O)[C@@]([H])(O)C([O-])=O","cofactor_name":"Ferrous gluconate","cofactor_resource_id":"DB14488","mechanism_of_action":"Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin.
