# Lambda-BER-Schema Facility Reference Data
# Authoritative definitions for research facilities and their instruments
#
# These files provide reference data for beamlines and instruments. They are intended as:
# - Template examples for users defining their own instruments
# - Authoritative metadata that can be imported into datasets
# - Documentation of known beamlines/instruments with validated metadata
#
# Note: These are NOT schema files - they are data instances that conform to the schema.
